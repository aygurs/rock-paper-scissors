Rock, paper, scissors game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# How to play
The game consists of 5 rounds. Whoever has the most points by the end of the 5 rounds win!

You get a point if you beat the computer, and the computer gets a point if it beats you. If you draw, none of you get a point.

At the end of the 5 rounds, either you will win, the computer wins, or you draw.

You can choose to play again by clicking the 'Play again?' button.

# Future Updates
Updates I could push in the future include:
- GUI update
- Game modes

# Why I made this project
This project was my first proper project using HTML, CSS and JS. I had never used the DOM before this either. It was great to create something interactive and that actually has a purpose as a game! It taught me a lot and is one of my foundational projects!
